# WP Client Documents

A Wordpress plugin to easily manage files between users into Wordpress Administration.

You can upload files and make then acessible just for the clients that an administrator defines.

This project is a refactor of the great [client-document-monitoring](http://https://github.com/hiteshjoshi/client-document-monitoring).
